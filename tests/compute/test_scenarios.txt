# For comparing performance during heavy workload
Used simple discrete policy with 0.65 and 0.2 max/min
20 mins (1200) of heavy sensors (12) -> simple test case in test_scaling.sh


# For comparing discrete and adaptive policies
Tested Yo Yo with 30 sec flip/flop sensors for 5 mins
Set adaptive params -> Alpha: 0.25 Beta: 0.15 
Set max for both ast: 0.65 and min at: 0.2
Monitoring interval for both policies: 10 secs
